## Overview
This file governs how Goose and any integrated extensions create, manage, and track code and tasks in the project.

## 1. Project Structure
- All source code belongs in `src/`.
- Shared logic in `src/utils/`.
- Extensions each get their own folder under `src/extensions/`.
- Config files live in `config/`.
- Progress tracking and logs in `progress/`.

## 2. Central Progress File
- Must be named `TASKS.md` within `progress/`.
- Always update tasks with `[x]` or `[~]` status upon each successful or partial completion.
- Document chain-of-thought summaries for each major milestone.

## 3. Chain of Thought
- Maintain ephemeral logs for reasoning steps (for debugging).
- Summaries of key decisions are appended to `progress/chain_of_thought.md`.

## 4. Self-Correction
- On error, attempt automatic fix (retry tokens, re-check config, etc.).
- If repeated failures, mark `[!] Blocked` in `TASKS.md` and note error details.

## 5. No Duplication
- Always scan existing files in `src/` before creating new ones.
- If a script or file exists for the same function, reuse or extend it.

## 6. Clean, Consistent Code
- Follow naming conventions for files and directories.
- Place environment variables in `.env` or `goose-config.json`.
- Keep documentation updated in `docs/`.
