# Backend Development Chain of Thought

## Database Schema Design

### User Model
1. Chose to include comprehensive user profile data to support:
   - KYC requirements for regulatory compliance
   - Customizable trading preferences
   - Security features (2FA, API keys)
   - Notification settings for various events
2. Used JSONB for flexible fields (preferences, notification_settings) to:
   - Allow schema evolution without migrations
   - Support dynamic user preferences
   - Enable complex querying capabilities

### Wallet Model
1. Implemented secure wallet management:
   - Encrypted private keys using AES-256-CBC
   - Separate available and locked balances
   - Support for multiple addresses per currency
   - Tracking of total received/sent amounts
2. Added wallet labeling and network type support for:
   - Multiple chains (e.g., ERC20, BEP20)
   - User-friendly wallet identification
   - Future cross-chain functionality

### Order Model
1. Designed comprehensive order system supporting:
   - Multiple order types (market, limit, stop, etc.)
   - Margin trading with isolated/cross margin
   - Advanced order features (FOK, IOC, GTC)
   - Detailed order tracking and history
2. Implemented constraints for data integrity:
   - Valid order types and sides
   - Status transitions
   - Time-in-force options
   - Margin types

### Trade Model
1. Created detailed trade tracking:
   - Maker/taker identification
   - Fee calculation and tracking
   - PnL calculation for margin trades
   - Support for trade analytics
2. Added features for market analysis:
   - Price history aggregation
   - Volume tracking
   - Trade statistics calculation
   - Performance metrics

### Transaction Model
1. Built robust transaction handling:
   - Blockchain transaction tracking
   - Multiple confirmation levels
   - Detailed error tracking
   - Support for different transaction types
2. Implemented comprehensive status tracking:
   - Pending/confirmed states
   - Error handling
   - Metadata for additional information
   - Fee tracking

## Technical Decisions

### Database Choice
1. Selected PostgreSQL for:
   - ACID compliance for financial transactions
   - JSONB support for flexible schemas
   - Strong indexing capabilities
   - Rich query functionality
   - Transaction support
   - Mature ecosystem

### Security Measures
1. Implemented multiple security layers:
   - Password hashing with bcrypt
   - Private key encryption
   - Rate limiting
   - JWT-based authentication
   - API key management
2. Added security constraints:
   - Input validation
   - Status transitions
   - Access control
   - Data sanitization

### Performance Optimization
1. Created strategic indexes for:
   - Frequently queried fields
   - Foreign key relationships
   - Timestamp-based queries
   - Status and type filters
2. Implemented efficient queries:
   - Pagination support
   - Optimized joins
   - Efficient aggregations
   - Proper use of indexes

### Scalability Considerations
1. Designed for horizontal scaling:
   - Stateless authentication
   - Redis for caching
   - Separate services for different functions
   - Asynchronous processing where possible
2. Prepared for high availability:
   - Database replication support
   - Load balancing ready
   - Failover capabilities
   - Backup strategies

## Next Steps

### API Development
1. Plan to implement:
   - RESTful endpoints
   - WebSocket connections
   - Rate limiting
   - Request validation
   - Error handling
   - Documentation

### Service Layer
1. Will develop:
   - Trading engine
   - Order matching system
   - Wallet management
   - External integrations
   - Background jobs

### Testing Strategy
1. Will create:
   - Unit tests for models
   - Integration tests for APIs
   - Performance tests
   - Security tests
   - End-to-end tests

### Monitoring and Maintenance
1. Plan to implement:
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring
   - Security auditing
   - Backup systems
   - Maintenance procedures
